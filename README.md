### Note on the usage of glmnet_py
The results in the 2021 paper listed above were derived with the [glmnet_py](https://github.com/bbalasub1/glmnet_python) package. This package currently however causes conflicts with many versions of _scipy_ and seems increasingly difficult for MAC users to work with. We therefore included `sparseRRR_scikit.py` as well as `demo_scikit.ipynb` that runs sparse reduced-rank regression without the need for _glmnet_py_ but uses _scikit-learn_. We believe this will help interested users in deploying sparse reduced-rank regression on their own data without the need for sophisticated environments or complicated dependencies.

Importantly, we adopted the _alpha_ and _l1_ratio_ nomenclature from _scikit-learn_ in that demo, meaning that _alpha_ controls the strength of overall group lasso + ridge regularization and _l1_ratio_ controls how much lasso vs ridge penalty you use (e.g. _l1_ratio_ equal to 1 corresponds to pure group lasso).
